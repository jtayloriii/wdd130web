                    In order to better help you understand the type of person I am, and how well I may be able to fit 
                    into your work environment, I have created this page to show some of my personal life and hobbies.
                    For the most part, my favorite activites involve flying, whether it be from my primary means of paramotoring,
                    or piloting sailplanes, having been raised by a former Marine Corp helicopter pilot, aviation has been a major 
                    passtime of mine.

                    <h2>Caribbean Sailing</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond that, I have learned to sail sailing yachts in the Caribbean, (50-foot long 
                    non-motorized boat,) and I have also had the opportunities to visit various parts of the globe, including but
                    not limited to Vietnam, Peru, and Central China on school-sponsored cultural trips. Lastly, when I was younger
                    I also would avidly run half-marathons, often competing for solely for fun.

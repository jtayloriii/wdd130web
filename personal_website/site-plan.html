      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose for this website is to create a basic yet interactive resume. I want this website
        to show my skills, work experience and academic career in an easy to read format, and be as appealing
        to a potential employer as possible. Using a website alongside a single resume document PDF, I can 
        have both a basic means of appealing myself to an emplyoer as well as a interactive and more all-encompassing
        way of doing so. Giving the hiring position the ability to choose.</all-encompassing></p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My targeted audience would generally be any potential employer interested in hiring me, or to whom
        I have applied. Ideally, there would be little to no reason for any friends or strangers to see this, 
        so I would have no need to put in personal or exciting information, but rather simply my professional 
        career-relevant information. My audience, would be a classcally bored hirer, who has probably seen 
        many resumes in a given period of time and is likely tired of sifting through them. Therefore, I would
        need my site to be as simple and straightforward as possible, while still retaining a level of aesthetic
        appeal to show my skill in programming to a minor extent.

      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        For the front page I am hoping to have a brief introduction, followed
        by my resume and links to my educational experience, work experience,
        (possibly as two separate pages) as well as a hobbies and personal
        information page. However, as this siteplan page is small, here 
        are illegible, but compressed photos of my resume I will use 
        on the page.

      <h3>Page 2 - Work and Educational Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Education -
        During my higher education experience, I have attended two univeristies.
        Firstly, I attended school at Texas A&M University in College Station Texas with a 3.0
        GPA. Due to wanting more outdoor, and mountainous activity options such as hiking, 
        flying, skiing, and even sand duning, I transferred to Brigham Young University - Idaho.
        While there, I obtained a 3.7 GPA with a Computer Science focus for my course work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work - 
        Thus far, I have had two major work experiences. First was immediately after high school, 
        wherein I interned at a hydroponics farm to study modern horticulture. During the three months
        I was there, I was given full oversight of the hydroponics subdivision after approximately a 
        month and a half. While I was hoping for my technological work, the experience I gained there 
        was monumentally challenging in far more physical ways, and taught me valuable resillience 
        pulling weeds around the pools in over 100 degree weather, and transferring plant float beds with
        a consistent rotation. 
        My second major work experience was during my time as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of
        Latter Day Saints in the Kiribati/Marshall Islands region. Working 10 hours a day six days a week, 
        without running water, air conditioning, beds, or walls around our sleeping huts, all while biking 
        4 hours a day in an average of 100 degree weather, I was again taught resilience and perseverance 
        through difficult work environments and challenges.

      <h3>Page 3 - Personal Life and Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        In order to better help you understand the type of person I am, and how well I may be able to fit 
        into your work environment, I have created a separate page to show some of my personal life and hobbies.
        For the most part, my favorite activites involve flying, whether it be from my primary means of paramotoring,
        or piloting sailplanes, having been raised by a former Marine Corp helicopter pilot, aviation has been a major 
        passtime of mine. Beyond that, I have learned to sail sailing yachts in the Caribbean, (50-foot long 
        non-motorized boat,) and I have also had the opportunities to visit various parts of the globe, including but
        not limited to Vietnam, Peru, and Central China on school-sponsored cultural trips. Lastly, when I was younger
        I also would avidly run half-marathons, often competing for solely for fun.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        My home page would be very simple and straightforward. Only having links to my other pages,
        my logo, and my digital resume.
      </p>
      <img src="images/home.png" alt="Home page wireframe">

      <h3>Work and Educational Experience</h3>
      <p>         
        This page would pertain to more relevant things for an employer, such as work experience, 
        education, and any details regarding them that I would not be able to include on my resume
        due to the need for brevity.
      </p>
      <img src="images/work.png" alt="Work page">

      <h3>Personal Life and Hobbies</h3>
      <p>         
        This would be a unique and less important part of my website, simply showing "who I am" as 
        a person as best I can without actually meeting someone. Essentially showing hobbies and interests
        and whether or not I would make a good fit for their work community.
